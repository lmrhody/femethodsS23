First, we import the URLLIB package, and specifically the `request` module. We assign the URL we want to manipulate by assigning the URL to a variable. Next, we pass the URL through the urlopen.request function from the URLLIB package, and also at the same time \"read\" the file. The output of that string becomes the variable `html`. When we print the variable html, we discover that all of the HTML from the page has been pulled into the variable name. Unfortuantely, it doesn't look very clean. "
