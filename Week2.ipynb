This year we will start using Google Collaboratory. There are several technologies stacked here, so it's ok if it feels confusing--that's because it is a little. \n",

        "First, Jupyter Notebooks (once called Python Notebooks, and I apologize if I slip when I'm referring to them sometimes) is a simplified, partially graphical way of running Python using the browser. It allows you to integrate markdown (or text) alongside code snippets, and the code can be executed directly in a browser window. That means that you're running a little Python kernal (like a mini server) in the background of your computer. Google Colab (or Collaboratory) takes Jupyter notebooks and expands on it, allowint you to work in a computational environment just like Jupyter notebooks, but using Google's computing power and in a way that can be directly saved like your any Google doc using Google Drive. \n",

That file will have an icon at the top that says \"Open in Colab.\" Click on that link. That will open up the notebook in Google Colab. Before you do anything else, go to the menu at the top left of your window and clicek File --> Save a copy in Drive. You will see that the icon at the top left changes from the GitHub icon to the Google Drive icon, and the name of the file has changed to something starting with \"Copy of...\" From this point, follow these steps: \n",

Hover your mouse over the brackets, and you can click the \"play\" icon when it appears. Alternatively, you can click on the highlighted area. The cell will become editable. You can then press Control + Return (on Mac) or CTRL + Enter (on PC) and run the cell. When the cell runs, if there is an output, it will appear in the notebook directly below the code. \n",
