When you are actually doing your own text analysis project, you will have a much messier process. During this week's reading, you will have read several pieces about what cleaning takes place and some of the challenges that data presents when working with text. In particular, we're looking at text analysis from a humanities / litereary perspective; however, one might argue that these challenges are more similar to the text analysis one might perform in the social sciences or with non-fiction work than might appear to be the case on the surface. \n",

However, we can also use another module from the URLLIB package that is designed to import an .html file directly from the web. We can actually do this with just a few lines of code. First, we import the URLLIB package, and specifically the `request` module. We assign the URL we want to manipulate by assigning the URL to a variable. Next, we pass the URL through the urlopen.request function from the URLLIB package, and also at the same time \"read\" the file. The output of that string becomes the variable `html`. When we print the variable html, we discover that all of the HTML from the page has been pulled into the variable name. Unfortuantely, it doesn't look very clean. "

I heard a very instruc\\ntive and interesting.talk by Prof. Mc\\nClintock at the Lawndaje Civic Cen\\nter on \"The Value of Popular\\nPoetry.\" \"The greatest art of the\\npoet,\" said the learned professor, \"is\\nto study popular taste and give them\\nwhat they want\"\\nIt is unfortunate that the classes\\nunderstand so well the psychology of\\nthe masses and are therefore able to\\nplay upon their emotion as a musi\\ncian plays upon a harp. They feed\\nthem with poetry which appeals to\\nthe most ingrained prejudices of\\nman.\\nPoetry is not creative at best That\\nis, it does not .teach nor discover\\noriginal ideas; it either tends to ap\\npeal to the emotions and prejudices\\nof the race, or it revolves round some\\nprogressive idea as a sattelite and\\nhelps to inspire humanitarians to\\nfight until they have reached their\\ngoal.\\nPopular poetry is not poetry which\\nappeals wholly to the primitive feel\\nings of man, as that appeals to all\\nsections of mankind. The poetry the\\npeople are fed with is such as tend\\nto aid to perpetuate existing institu\\ntions.. The prpfessor said that the people\\nwere not intellectual but they are es\\nsentially sentimental. They like grue\\nsome and realistic tales. True, but\\nthe profesor failed to give the rea\\nsons for such popular taste.\\nTo the classes such taste appeals\\nto be low, popular and vulgar. For\\nit is easy for men who do not know\\nthe turmoils and strifes of life to\\nutter opinions on the low tastes and\\nsentimentality of the people. The\\nmasses find woe and sorrow at every\\nangle they turn. That is the reason\\nwhy woeful stories touch them. The\\nwealthy classes know of no other\\nwoes but that which nature imposes\\nupon them. The people suffer untold\\nmiseries which man imposes upon\\nman, hence their extreme sentimen\\ntality. The mental energies of the work\\ners exhausts itself in their daily\\ndrudgery and toil, therefore they do\\nnot think clearly upon their own in\\nterests. But a new and happier day\\nis dawning on the human horizon.\\nThe workers are demanding better\\nopportunities of self development and\\nfor self-expression. The spirit of as\\npiration animates them with the\\nsame zeal as it animated aristocratic\\nFaust, but the spirit of negation is\\nkeener in their case.\\nThe day will eventually dawn when,\\nthe titan of capitalism and oppres\\nsion will be conquered. Then \"The\\nAbysm will vomit forth the secrets\\nof nature\" even to the disinherited\\nmultitude. Sam Druck.\\nTEACHERS\\' HOURS. I have\\nheard so many confused statements\\nmade regarding the working hours of\\nteachers and their \"easy\" work that\\nI am constrained to give to those\\nwho \"desire truth and justice above\\nall things\" a real knowledge of the\\nactual facts.\\nAll teachers must be in their rooms\\nat 8:45 a. m. and 1 p. m. or be marked\\ntardy.

High school\\nteachers go on duty at least 15 min\\nutes before 9 a. m., have 30 minutes\\nfor lunch (and perhaps have to eat\\nthat in a study room in charge of\\nstudents.)

He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They\\'ve simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world\\'s wise men has wisely told us:\\n\"Words are the only things that live forever.\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one\\'s mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you\\'d dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman\\'s ear and whisper:\\nI\\'d like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he\\'d have me shot.\\nIt isn\\'t what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe\\'s ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you\\'re the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I\\'ll report you, sir! You\\'ll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\"ads\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here\\'s where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou\\'re very kind, I\\'m sure, and now\\nI\\'ll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \"He\" does aught for \"Her,\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.', 'batch': 'dlc_weimaraner_ver02', 'title_normal': 'evening star.', 'url': 'https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1905-11-19/ed-1/seq-41.json', 'place': ['District of Columbia--Washington'], 'page': '13'}, {'sequence': 42, 'county': [None], 'edition': None, 'frequency': 'Daily', 'id': '/lccn/sn83045462/1905-11-19/ed-1/seq-42/', 'subject': ['Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505', 'Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers.'], 'city': ['Washington'], 'date': '19051119', 'title': 'Evening star.

Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you\\'d have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker\\'s flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\"Use Blum\\'s Stove Polish,\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum\\'s Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people\\'s true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life.

Poems are more easy to re\\nmember than prose because of their\\nrhyme. In prose we have things told\\njust as though we were talking to each\\nother. Prose is used to tell almost any\\nkind of a story or to describe anything.\\nThere are beautiful scenes in the world,\\ngrand things in history and noble\\nthoughts that can be much better de\\nscribed in poetry.\\nWhen our far-off forefathers could\\nrot even read or write they had poets\\n•who went with them into battle and\\nafter the victory these poets or \\'bards\\'\\nas they were called would compose\\nverses of fine-sounding words to cele\\nbrate the victory. These verses were\\nsung while they played the harp. Per\\nhaps in this way poetry began and\\nmen found they could best utter their\\nhappiness by choosing words of a\\nmusical sound.\\nThere are three kinds of poetry.\\n•Dramatic poetry is written in the form\\nof people speaking to each other as in\\nthe plays of Shakespeare. Then we\\nhave epic poetry which is usually a\\ndescription of some great event, or\\n.hero, or the history of a nation. The\\nthird is called lyric poetry because it\\n•was originally intended to be sung to\\nthe playing of the lyre. All beautiful\\nsongs fall in the lyric class of poetry.\\nWe know poems sometimes rhyme\\nand sometimes they do not. The num-\"\\nber of syllables in a line of poetry de\\npends on the plan of the poet. We-can\\ntrain ourselves to^know when there\\nare too many or too few for the plan.\\nThis also helps in the rhythm of music.\\nMuch of our finest poetry has no\\nrhyme in it. A poem with no rhyme\\nIs called \"blank verse.\\'\\nWe can understand great poems\\n•without knowing all about the differ*\\nent styles of poetry. Strictly speaking\\na single line of poetry is a verse, but\\nusually any number of lines over two\\nIs called a verse.. Another name for\\na verse is stanza. Short verses of only\\ntwo lines or any pair of lines ending\\n•with the same rhyme are called coutf\\nlets.\\nThere are many divisions of lyric\\n^poetry. A very popular form is the\\'\\nsennet which is the most beautiful\\nstyle of all the shorter poems. A son\\n-net is composed of fourteen lines—no\\n\\'more or less. Some of our finest\\npoetry is in the form of these little\\nfourteen-line\\n~mr\\npoems.
