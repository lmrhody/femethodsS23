However, we'll be following along with the online version, which is regularly updated and can be found at http://nltk.org/book. You may wish to begin by reading the Preface to the book (https://www.nltk.org/book/ch00.html), which explains some of the mechanics for reading and following along with activities. You will read the definitional distinctions between **natural** and **artificial** language. \n",

You can also use the Anaconda Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution). Once you install the NLTK package, you'll need to install necessary datasets/models for future assignments to work. \n",

        "\n",

        "* How can we automatically extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and content of a text?\n",

        "This chapter is divided into sections that skip between two quite different styles. In the \"computing with language\" sections we will take on some linguistically motivated programming tasks without necessarily explaining how they work. In the \"closer look at Python\" sections we will systematically review key programming concepts. We'll flag the two styles in the section titles, but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it. We hope this style of introduction gives you an authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science. If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to 5; we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything you can easily consult the online reference material at http://nltk.org/. If the material is completely new to you, this chapter will raise more questions than it answers, questions that are addressed in the rest of this book."

        "So Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or \"tokens.\" A **token** is the technical name for a sequence of characters — such as ```hairy, his, or :) ``` — that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase _to be or not to be_, we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of _to_, two of _be_, and one each of _or_ and _not_. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the set of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of ```text3 ``` with the command: ```set(text3)```. When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following:"

These parentheses will show up often; their role is to separate the name of a task — such as ```lexical_diversity()``` — from the data that the task is to be performed on — such as ```text3```. The data value that we place in the parentheses when we call a function is an **argument** to the function.\n",

Functions are an important concept in programming, and we only mention them at the outset to give newcomers a sense of the power and creativity of programming. Don't worry if you find it a bit confusing right now.\n",

Now we can express the words of interest using mathematical set notation as shown in [1a](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html#ex-set-comprehension-math).

Have we succeeded in automatically extracting words that typify a text? Well, these very long words are often hapaxes (i.e., unique) and perhaps it would be better to find _frequently occurring long words_. This seems promising since it eliminates frequent short words (e.g., _the_) and infrequent long words (e.g. _antiphilosophists_).

        "We start by deriving a list of the lengths of words in text1, and the FreqDist then counts the number of times each of these occurs. The result is a distribution containing a quarter of a million items, each of which is a number corresponding to a word token in the text. But there are at most only 20 distinct items being counted, the numbers 1 through 20, because there are only 20 different word lengths. I.e., there are words consisting of just one character, two characters, ..., twenty characters, but none with twenty one or more characters. One might wonder how frequent the different lengths of word are (e.g., how many words of length four appear in the text, are there more words of length five than length four, etc). We can do this as follows:"
