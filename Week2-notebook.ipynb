        "First, Jupyter Notebooks (once called Python Notebooks, and I apologize if I slip when I'm referring to them sometimes) is a simplified, partially graphical way of running Python using the browser. It allows you to integrate markdown (or text) alongside code snippets, and the code can be executed directly in a browser window. That means that you're running a little Python kernal (like a mini server) in the background of your computer. Google Colab (or Collaboratory) takes Jupyter notebooks and expands on it, allowint you to work in a computational environment just like Jupyter notebooks, but using Google's computing power and in a way that can be directly saved like your any Google doc using Google Drive. \n",
