You may wish to begin by reading the Preface to the book (https://www.nltk.org/book/ch00.html), which explains some of the mechanics for reading and following along with activities.

In the \"closer look at Python\" sections we will systematically review key programming concepts. We'll flag the two styles in the section titles, but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it. We hope this style of introduction gives you an authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science. If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to 5; we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything you can easily consult the online reference material at http://nltk.org/.

        "So Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or \"tokens.\" A **token** is the technical name for a sequence of characters — such as ```hairy, his, or :) ``` — that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase _to be or not to be_, we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of _to_, two of _be_, and one each of _or_ and _not_. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the set of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of ```text3 ``` with the command: ```set(text3)```. When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following:"

Although it has 44,764 tokens, this book has only 2,789 distinct words, or \"word types.\" A **word type** is the form or spelling of the word independently of its specific occurrences in a text — that is, the word considered as a unique item of vocabulary. Our count of 2,789 items will include punctuation symbols, so we will generally call these unique items **types** instead of word types.\n",
